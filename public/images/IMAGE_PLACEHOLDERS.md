# Image Placeholders Guide

Since actual product images need to be sourced, here are some suggestions for placeholder images that match the HomeCanvas aesthetic:

## Quick Setup with Placeholder Services

You can use these placeholder services temporarily:

1. **Unsplash Source API** (Recommended for high-quality images):
   - Furniture: `https://source.unsplash.com/800x800/?modern-furniture`
   - Lighting: `https://source.unsplash.com/800x800/?pendant-lights`
   - Decor: `https://source.unsplash.com/800x800/?home-decor`
   - Garden: `https://source.unsplash.com/800x800/?outdoor-furniture`

2. **Placeholder.com** (For testing):
   - `https://via.placeholder.com/800x800?text=Furniture`
